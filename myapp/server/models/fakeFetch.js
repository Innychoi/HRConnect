    "description": "{ greeting: 'Hello there!' }\n\nI've never really had a clear idea of what I wanted to do for most of my life. Luckily, I discovered my passion for problem solving in my Intro to CS course in college. Since then, I have continued to chase the software dream. It's been a roller coaster of a ride, with a bit more downs than ups but I'm here ready to code and determined to solve any problem. \n\nI graduated with a B.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Richmond, worked as a Jr. Web Designer for about a year at a startup in Santa Monica, and decided to further develop my skills and fill in some knowledge gaps as an engineer by graduating from an intensive bootcamp program with Hack Reactor. \n\nAs an avid basketball fan, I love watching teams work together. Teamwork brings out the beauty of basketball, and no one player can carry a team to a championship. Likewise, I value the community that software engineering has brought me into and love meeting and working with fellow engineers. Feel free to connect with me!",

Prior to software engineering, I worked as a data analyst and researcher in the education policy sector. Although I loved research, I quickly realized that software engineers were making the most significant impact not just in education but across every industry.\n\nI am comfortable working as an individual contributor and collaboratively as a leader, and I have worked on every part of the stack from creating responsive applications in React/Redux/CSS to optimizing database query times in PostgreSQL. I love spending time learning new algorithms, data structures, and the latest tools in web development.\n\nWhen I am not coding, you can find me trying new recipes, hiking, or rollerblading around Golden Gate Park. If you would like to discuss software engineering, nerd out about education policy research, or exchange favorite recipes, feel free to contact me at catherinestraus@berkeley.edu 😃\n\nTechnical Skills:\nFrontend: JavaScript ES6+, TypeScript, ReactJS, Redux, jQuery, HTML/CSS, webpack, Babel, styled-components\nBackend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, Cassandra, Firebase, NGINX, Amazon\nWeb Services (EC2, S3), Docker, New Relic, K6, Loader.io, Linux\nOther: R, SQL, Github, Git, Mocha/Chai, Jest/Enzyme",

I like to try new things and learn cutting-edge technologies since I was a little kid. I love solving problems and challenges because I found it is very interesting. \n\nI used to be a content analyst working on data extraction. While doing data analysis, I found my passion for coding when we can match different keywords with a single line of code. I like solving problems with algorithms. I feel accomplished when I can solve a problem with program languages. I am also a fast learner and have an open mind to new technologies.\n\nI like going hiking or playing board games with friends in my personal time. I would like to try all the outdoor activities. Now my favorite one is snowboarding and my next go-to activity is diving.\n\nFeel free to reach out to me if you’d like to chat and network!\n\n\nTech Stack:\nFront end: JavaScript ES6, React / React Hooks / Redux, XPath, jQuery, Babel, Webpack, Python\nBack end: Node.js, Express, Fastify, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, AWS, Nginx, RESTful APIs\nTesting: Mocha / Chai, Enzyme,  Jest, Loader.io, K6, New Relic",

    "description": "Ever since I was a child, I've always embraced my artistic side. As a Software Engineer, I've been able to channel my creative side to create innovative and intuitive solutions. From design to implementation and release, I take great pride in my tenacious work ethic when tackling difficult challenges. I'm a team player that isn't afraid to lead a project to its success, or follow a more experienced team member and execute a shared vision. I have experience primarily in Javascript including Node.js, React & Redux, and Angular. \n\nI love to learn new technologies and I'm constantly expanding my technical horizons. I'm currently studying Blockchain applications and Artificial Intelligence in my spare time. One of my goals is to get a Masters or PhD in Computer Science.\n\nI've also had extensive experience in the real estate, sales, and economics. I've worked in real estate in appraising, loan processing, and property management for most of my life. I've also taken a sales position selling airplane parts where I learned valuable interpersonal skills. Finally, I graduated with a BS from UC Riverside in Economics.\n\nWhen I'm not working, I enjoy crafting jewelry, photography, and wine-tasting.\n\nI have found that nothing satisfies me more than meeting new people, developing new relationships, and solving problems. I'm always open to expanding my network so please don't hesitate to contact me if you think I could be a fit to your business vision.",
